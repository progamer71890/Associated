# Exercise 1

Write an application that asks for a user's first and last name and height. 

a. Add this person and their info to the following arrays:

> var firstNames = ['Bones', 'Welma', 'Frank', 'Han', 'Jack']

> var lastNames  = ['Smith', 'Seger', 'Mathers', 'Solo', 'Jackles']

> var heights = [158, 169, 172, 183, 201]

b. Alter your above program so that the person is added to the arrays in "height order". For example, if the new person's height is 178, they should be placed into the structure after Frank, who has a height of 172 and before Han, who has a height of 183.
